# Plans for Advanced Feature

## Phase 1: Should be done with currently aviliable thing
- Settings route to change the color theme of the app
- Use an external file to store the app settings and load the file once the app starts
- Add gengre to books and sort the books by gengre
- Add ratings and let user rate the books
- Add sort by on search page. Sort by name, author, gengre and rating


## Phase 2: Add new books to the app
- Have no idea about the backend function now. If we can, add the book to the backend, if we can't just add to a local datafile

## Phase 3: Add the book content
- Use some other API to generate book content inside the books. The content will be faked
- Let user to choose chapters to read
- Store the chapter the user read last time for each book
- Store whether the user has read a book or not, if yes, display the last chapter the user read
