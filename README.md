## Additional Features beyond requirements

### Detail Page
There is a link for the title of each books in bookshelves, search page and discover page. If you click the link, you will be redirected to a detail page containing all the detailed information of that book. You can also buy or preview the book in that page.

### Discover Page
There are two buttons on the main page. The plus button is the original one which directs to the search page. There is another button above the plus button with a magnifying glass. If you click that button, you will be redirected to the discover page. 

This is another version of the search page, and you don't need to specify a query for books. This is useful if you just want to read some books you are interested in. I actually think this is way more useful to me than the search page that need some query to run on.

This is achieved by running multiple search queries with selected predefined search terms from `SEARCH_TERMS.md`
